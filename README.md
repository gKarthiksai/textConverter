# textConverter
This piece of code enables you to convert your code to pure lower case or purely upper cased letters.
Copy/pull the code to your system on a java supportive ide and compile it. 
Then type in the text that you want to change.
You will get 2 outputs after the compilation is done : 1.) Lower cased
                                                       2.) Upper cased
